# Hardwired Control Unit (CU)

A combinational Hardwired Control Unit responsible for generating the processor's 15-bit control word. The Control Unit decodes the current instruction opcode together with the processor T-State and status flags to generate all control signals required for instruction fetch, data transfer, arithmetic execution, memory access, and conditional branching.

Unlike a microprogrammed controller, all control signals are generated directly using combinational logic, providing deterministic instruction execution with low hardware complexity and latency.

## Features

* Hardwired combinational control logic
* 15-bit control word generation
* Opcode-based instruction decoding
* T-State based instruction sequencing
* Conditional branch evaluation using processor flags
* Parameterized T-State width
